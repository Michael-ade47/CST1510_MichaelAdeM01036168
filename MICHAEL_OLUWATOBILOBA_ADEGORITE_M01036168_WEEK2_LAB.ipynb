The program randomly generates two single-digit integers, number1 and number2, and displays to the student a question such as; What is 1 * 7. After the student types the answer, the program displays a message to indicate whether it is true or false.\n\nTo generate a random number, you can use the randint(a, b) function in the random module. This function returns a random integer i between a and b, inclusively. To obtain a random integer between 0 and 9, use randint(0, 9).\n\nThe program may be set up to work as follows:\nStep 1: Randomly generate two single-digit integers for number1 (e.g., 4) and number 2 (e.g., 5)\nStep 2: Prompt the student to answer, \"What is 4 * 5?\" (user input)\nStep 3: Check whether the student’s answer is correct.
